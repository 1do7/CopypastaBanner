## How to setup:
**YOUR TERMINAL NEEDS TO SUPPORT PRINTING BRALLIE CHARACTERS**
**You can use the minified version to make it run faster**

Install requests libary
```
pip install requests
```
Just add this to your .bashrc file located in your home directory:
```
python BANNER_LOCATION/banner.py
```
replace BANNER_LOCATION with wherever you want to store this script.

And you're done :p
